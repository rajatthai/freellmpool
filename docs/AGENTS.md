# Using llmbuffet as the free LLM backend for AI agents

Most agent frameworks and coding agents speak the **OpenAI API**. Because
`llmbuffet proxy` *is* an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, you can point them at it
and they'll run on pooled free-tier inference — with failover when one provider
rate-limits you mid-run (exactly when long agent loops tend to die).

Start the gateway once:

```bash
llmbuffet proxy --port 8080
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=anything   # ignored by llmbuffet
```

Then wire up your tool of choice.

## OpenAI Python SDK / OpenAI Agents SDK

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()  # reads OPENAI_BASE_URL + OPENAI_API_KEY
resp = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",  # let llmbuffet pick the least-used free provider
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Plan a 3-step refactor of foo.py"}],
)
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)
```

See [`examples/agent_openai_sdk.py`](../examples/agent_openai_sdk.py) for a
runnable version.

## aider (AI pair programming in your terminal)

```bash
export OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=anything
aider --model openai/auto
```

## Continue / Cline / any "OpenAI-compatible" provider box

In the provider settings, set:

- **Base URL:** `http://localhost:8080/v1`
- **API key:** anything
- **Model:** `auto`, or pin one like `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile`

## LangChain

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/v1",
    api_key="anything",
    model="auto",
)
print(llm.invoke("Summarize the singleton pattern in one line.").content)
```

## Why this is nice for agents specifically

- **Failover mid-run.** A long agent loop that would otherwise die on a single
  provider's `429` transparently rolls to the next free pool.
- **More total throughput.** Agents are token-hungry; pooling several free
  tiers multiplies your daily ceiling.
- **One config.** Point every tool at one base URL instead of juggling a
  different SDK and key per provider.

> Heads up: free-tier models are smaller/faster than frontier models. They're
> great for triage, drafting, classification, and tool-routing steps; reach for
> a frontier model for the hardest reasoning. `llmbuffet` is about making the
> cheap-and-plentiful path effortless, not replacing GPT-class models.
