# Contributing to llmbuffet

Thanks for helping! The two highest-value contributions are **adding free
providers** and **keeping the existing catalog accurate** as free tiers drift.

## Dev setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xzr/llmbuffet
cd llmbuffet
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest          # 0 network calls — everything is faked
ruff check src tests
```

## Adding a provider

The whole catalog is [`src/llmbuffet/providers.toml`](src/llmbuffet/providers.toml).
Most providers are OpenAI-compatible, so adding one is just a TOML block:

```toml
[[provider]]
id = "myprovider"
label = "My Provider"
adapter = "openai"                       # "openai" | "gemini" | "cloudflare"
base_url = "https://api.myprovider.ai/v1"
key_env = "MYPROVIDER_API_KEY"           # env var the user sets; never a key
models = [
    { name = "some-model", rpd = 0 },    # rpd = free daily request hint, 0 = unknown
]
```

Rules of thumb:

- **Free tier only.** llmbuffet is about free pools. If a provider needs a card
  on file to use the tier, it doesn't belong in the default catalog.
- **Never commit a key.** Only the *name* of the env var goes in the catalog.
- If the provider isn't OpenAI-compatible, it needs a small adapter in
  [`src/llmbuffet/client.py`](src/llmbuffet/client.py) (see the `gemini` one for
  a ~30-line template) and a unit test in `tests/`.
- Add the env var to [`.env.example`](.env.example) and the signup steps to
  [`docs/ACCOUNTS.md`](docs/ACCOUNTS.md).

## Fixing a stale limit or endpoint

Free tiers change constantly. If a model name, base URL, or daily limit is
wrong, a one-line PR to `providers.toml` is perfect and very welcome.

## Tests

Every code path is unit-tested without touching the network via an injected
fake transport (`tests/helpers.py`). Please keep it that way — new behavior
should come with a fake-backed test. Run `pytest` and `ruff check` before
opening a PR.

## Code of conduct

Be kind. Assume good faith. We're all here to make free LLMs easier to use.
