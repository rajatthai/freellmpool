"""In-process per-target performance metrics: latency and success rate.

Every (provider, model) call records a success (with its wall-clock latency) or a
failure here. The router reads it back to keep load off providers that are slow or
currently failing, and ``freellmpool benchmark`` prints it as a table.

This is live routing signal, not persistence: it lives in memory, is thread-safe,
and resets on restart. Latency is smoothed with an EWMA so one slow call doesn't
banish a provider and one fast call doesn't crown it.
