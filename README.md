# freellmpool

Pool the free tiers of 16 LLM providers (200+ live-validated models) behind one
OpenAI-compatible endpoint — as a CLI, a Python library, or a local proxy.
Works with no API keys.

Groq, Cerebras, NVIDIA NIM, Google Gemini, OpenRouter, GitHub Models, Cloudflare,
Mistral, Cohere and others each give away a free tier — but each has its own SDK,
rate limits, and daily cap. freellmpool puts them in one pool: it sends each
request to a provider you have access to, fails over to the next when one is rate
limited or down, and tracks per-day usage so you get the most out of every tier.

Two providers (Pollinations and OVHcloud) need no API key, so a fresh install
answers immediately:

```console
$ pip install freellmpool
$ freellmpool ask "Explain the CAP theorem in one sentence."
A distributed system can guarantee at most two of consistency, availability, and
partition tolerance at the same time.
```

Add keys for the other providers to unlock more models and higher limits.

## Run a coding agent on free models

freellmpool's proxy speaks both the OpenAI and the Anthropic API, so coding agents
run against pooled free tiers with no code changes — just point them at the proxy:

```bash
freellmpool proxy                       # starts http://localhost:8080
freellmpool code claude                 # prints the one-line setup for Claude Code
# (also: codex, aider, cline, continue, cursor, opencode)
```

Claude Code gateway mode can also be launched directly:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=dummy \
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=auto \
ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL=auto \
CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1 \
claude
```

Your existing OpenAI/Anthropic apps work the same way — set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (or
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`) to the proxy and keep your code unchanged.

**OpenCode** gets a deeper integration: a live in-editor **dashboard** (routing mode,
$ saved, tokens served free, provider race, latency), per-request **quality routing**
via the model picker (`freellmpool/auto|fast|quality|fair`), and `freellmpool_status`
/ `freellmpool_models` tools — see [integrations/opencode-tui](integrations/opencode-tui)
and the [guide](https://0xzr.github.io/freellmpool/run-opencode-on-free-models.html).

**New in 0.11:** capacity tools — `freellmpool capacity status` shows which free
tiers are usable right now, `freellmpool providers health` live-probes them, and
`freellmpool keys add` walks you through configuring more (see
[Capacity & provider health](#capacity--provider-health) and
[docs/CAPACITY.md](docs/CAPACITY.md)).

**New in 0.10:** an async API (`AsyncPool`), an MCP server (`freellmpool mcp`),
latency-aware routing with `freellmpool benchmark`, observability hooks, and a
plugin system for custom providers. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Install

```bash
pip install freellmpool      # or: pipx install freellmpool
```

Only dependency is `httpx`. Python 3.11+.

## Command line

```bash
freellmpool ask "Write a haiku about sqlite"
git diff | freellmpool ask "Write a commit message for this"
freellmpool tokenmax "Hardest question you've got"  # 🌈 blast EVERY model, synthesize the swarm
freellmpool providers        # which providers are configured
freellmpool models           # every provider/model id
freellmpool stats            # lifetime tokens served free + avoided cost
freellmpool badge -o badge.svg   # a shareable SVG badge of that total
```

`freellmpool tokenmax` is the tongue-in-cheek maximum-effort mode: it fans your
prompt out to **every model across every provider** at once, prints each answer, and
synthesizes one best verdict — flashing a rainbow `TOKENMAXXING` animation in your
terminal while it runs. (Also available as the `tokenmax` MCP tool — see
[docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md).)

`freellmpool stats` is a running, **persistent** lifetime total (it survives restarts
and upgrades). Embed `freellmpool badge` in a README, or serve it live from the proxy
at `/badge.svg` (set `FREELLMPOOL_PUBLIC_BADGE=1` to make it publicly embeddable).

Pin a provider or model; common OpenAI/Anthropic model names are mapped to a free
equivalent so existing scripts keep working:

```bash
freellmpool ask -m groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile "hi"
freellmpool ask -p cerebras,groq "hi"
freellmpool ask -m gpt-4o-mini "hi"      # routed to a free model
```

## As a proxy

Run a local server that speaks the OpenAI API, then point any OpenAI-compatible
tool at it:

```bash
freellmpool proxy
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=unused
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()
print(client.chat.completions.create(
    model="auto",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
).choices[0].message.content)

# audio → text (Whisper), same client:
print(client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="auto", file=open("audio.mp3", "rb"),
).text)
```

Or with `curl` (multipart upload):

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -F file=@audio.mp3 -F model=auto
```

The proxy also implements the OpenAI Responses API (for the Codex CLI) and the
Anthropic Messages API (for Claude Code), so coding agents can run on free models
too. `freellmpool code <agent>` prints the exact setup:

```bash
freellmpool code aider       # also: claude, codex, cline, continue, cursor, opencode
```

Endpoints: `/v1/chat/completions` (token streaming, tool calling), `/v1/embeddings`,
`/v1/audio/transcriptions` (Whisper, multipart upload), `/v1/responses`, `/v1/messages`,
`/v1/models`, and a `/dashboard` page showing usage.
Setup snippets for specific tools are in [docs/INTEGRATIONS.md](docs/INTEGRATIONS.md)
and [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md).

## As a library

```python
from freellmpool import Pool

pool = Pool.from_default_config()
reply = pool.ask("Summarize the plot of Hamlet in 20 words.")
print(reply.text, "—", reply.provider_id)

vectors = pool.embed(["first document", "second document"]).vectors

with open("audio.mp3", "rb") as f:
    text = pool.transcribe(f.read(), "audio.mp3").text   # Whisper, failover across providers
```

Async is the same API with `await`:

```python
from freellmpool import AsyncPool

async with AsyncPool.from_default_config() as pool:
    reply = await pool.aask("Summarize the plot of Hamlet in 20 words.")
```

Pass `on_event=...` to either pool to receive structured routing events
(`attempt`/`success`/`error`/`cooldown`/`exhausted`) for logging or tracing. Add
your own endpoint with `register_provider(...)`, or a new request shape with
`register_adapter(name, fn)`.

## Benchmark your providers

`freellmpool benchmark` times one call per configured provider and prints
latency and success, so you can see which of your free tiers are fastest right
now. The router learns the same latency/success signal from real traffic as it
runs; set `FREELLMPOOL_ROUTING=fast` to prefer the lowest-latency provider
instead of the default least-used-first.

```
$ freellmpool benchmark
  provider/model            status   latency  note
  cerebras/llama-3.3-70b    ok        180 ms  6 tok
  groq/llama-3.3-70b        ok        240 ms  6 tok
  ovh/Meta-Llama-3_3-70B    FAIL           -  HTTP 429
```

## Capacity & provider health

Free tiers drift through the day — keys expire, providers go down, daily caps
fill. These commands tell you what's usable right now and what to set up next:

```bash
freellmpool capacity status --target 5   # who's healthy / near quota / missing a key
freellmpool providers health             # send one tiny request to each, time it
freellmpool keys checklist --target 5    # which keys to add to reach N healthy providers
freellmpool keys add groq                # configure a key (and record metadata)
```

`capacity status` is local-first: it reads your catalog, environment, and
per-day quota counters and labels each provider `healthy`, `low_quota`,
`exhausted`, `invalid_key`, or `missing`. It also syncs an advisory external
catalog ([mnfst/awesome-free-llm-apis](https://github.com/mnfst/awesome-free-llm-apis))
to suggest free providers you could add — advisory only; your `providers.toml`
stays the source of truth for routing. `keys add <name>` can even import a
suggested provider from that catalog or create an OpenAI-compatible stub and
autodiscover its models. The proxy `/dashboard` shows the same capacity at a
glance. Full reference: [docs/CAPACITY.md](docs/CAPACITY.md).

## As an MCP server

`freellmpool mcp` runs a Model Context Protocol server over stdio, so Claude
Desktop, Claude Code, or Cursor can hand subtasks to free models. See
[docs/MCP.md](docs/MCP.md). A [`server.json`](server.json) is included for the
[MCP registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## In Simon Willison's `llm` CLI

There's a plugin: `llm install llm-freellmpool` → `llm -m freellmpool "..."` with
no API key. Source: [0xzr/llm-freellmpool](https://github.com/0xzr/llm-freellmpool).

## Provider keys

freellmpool reads keys from the environment and uses whatever is set. None are
required. Step-by-step signup links for each (all free, no card) are in
[docs/ACCOUNTS.md](docs/ACCOUNTS.md).

| Provider | Env var | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pollinations | — | no key needed |
| OVHcloud | — | no key needed (anonymous tier) |
| LLM7 | `LLM7_API_KEY` | optional |
| Groq | `GROQ_API_KEY` | fast |
| Cerebras | `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | fast, large daily cap |
| NVIDIA NIM | `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | |
| OpenRouter | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | free models |
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | |
| GitHub Models | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | any PAT |
| Cloudflare | `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | |
| Mistral, Cohere, SambaNova, Z.ai, Ollama Cloud, LongCat | see `.env.example` | |

A `config.toml` (see [config.toml.example](config.toml.example)) can hold keys,
model aliases, and settings instead of env vars.

## How routing works

For each request, freellmpool builds the list of `(provider, model)` pairs you
have access to, then orders providers least-used-first and picks a least-used
model inside that provider. This keeps providers with large catalogs, like
NVIDIA, from receiving more traffic only because they expose more models. A
provider that returns a 429 is set aside for a cooldown window. Daily counts are
kept in `~/.config/freellmpool/quota.json` and reset at UTC midnight.

Every call records latency and success per model target. A provider whose targets
are currently failing sinks to the back automatically; with
`FREELLMPOOL_ROUTING=fast` the fastest measured provider goes first instead.
`freellmpool benchmark` warms these metrics on demand. To restore the old
per-model balancing behavior, set `FREELLMPOOL_ROUTING=legacy` or
`FREELLMPOOL_ROUTING=model` (or `FREELLMPOOL_ROUTING=model-fast` for the old
per-model fastest-first ordering).

**Quality routing (`FREELLMPOOL_ROUTING=quality`).** Free tiers' strongest models
have the smallest daily caps, so a naive pool gets weaker as the day fills. Quality
routing matches each prompt's *difficulty* to each model's *capability*: hard
prompts (long input, code, reasoning cues) go to the strongest available model, and
easy ones go to lightweight models — which rations scarce strong-model quota so the
pool stays sharp for longer. Capability is grounded in real benchmark data, not
guessed from names; models no benchmark lists fall back to a name heuristic.

The bundled, offline scores come from [LMArena](https://lmarena.ai/) Elo (an
MIT-licensed snapshot) and the [Aider](https://aider.chat/) code-editing
leaderboard (Apache-2.0), normalized to a common percentile scale. For much
broader coverage, run `freellmpool capability sync` with a free
[Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/) API key
(`FREELLMPOOL_AA_API_KEY`) — its Intelligence Index covers most current and
open-weight models and takes precedence. The fetched AA data is cached locally
under your own key (never bundled, per AA's terms). `freellmpool capability
status` shows current coverage. Scores via LMArena and Aider; intelligence index
via Artificial Analysis when keyed.

**Context windows.** Free models often have small context windows. freellmpool
never truncates your input; instead, when a model rejects a request as too long,
it learns that model's limit and stops routing oversized requests there, escalating
only to larger-window models. If nothing fits it raises a clear
`ContextWindowExceeded` (with the estimated input size) instead of a generic
failure — over the proxy that's a `413`. You can declare a model's window with
`context = N` in `providers.toml` to skip it proactively.

Architecture notes: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Limitations

- Free-tier models are smaller than frontier models. They're good for drafting,
  summarizing, classification, triage, and everyday coding — not a replacement
  for GPT-class reasoning on hard problems.
- Quality and capacity vary through the day as high-cap tiers exhaust; limits
  reset at UTC midnight.
- Free tiers change without notice. When a model id or limit goes stale, a
  one-line PR to `providers.toml` fixes it for everyone.
- The proxy is meant for local/single-user use. It binds to `127.0.0.1` by
  default; if you expose it, set a key (`--api-key`).
- The Claude Code / Anthropic path is experimental (text and tool use; no vision).
- These are free tiers shared by everyone — don't abuse them.

## How it compares

| Tool | What it is | Install | Keyless start | CLI / library / proxy / MCP |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **freellmpool** | Pools many providers' **free tiers** | `pip install` | Yes (2 providers) | All four |
| OpenRouter | Hosted paid aggregator (some free models) | API key | No | API only |
| LiteLLM | Multi-provider SDK/proxy (bring your own keys) | `pip install` | No | Library + proxy |
| Self-hosted free-API servers | A server you deploy | Docker + config | No | Server only |

freellmpool's niche is the **keyless, pip-installable client** for squeezing the
hosted free tiers — not a server you deploy, and not a paid aggregator.

## FAQ

**Is there a free, OpenAI-compatible LLM API gateway?** Yes — freellmpool is a free,
MIT-licensed gateway that exposes one OpenAI-compatible endpoint backed by the free
tiers of 16 providers. `pip install freellmpool` and point any OpenAI client at the
local proxy.

**How do I use multiple free LLM APIs at once?** freellmpool pools them: each request
goes to a provider you have access to, fails over to the next when one is rate-limited
or down, and tracks per-day usage so load spreads across tiers.

**Can I run Claude Code or Codex on free models?** Yes — the proxy speaks both the
OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. Set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` or `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to the proxy
and run Codex, Claude Code, aider, Cline, Continue, or Cursor unchanged. For Claude
Code, set `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1` so `/v1/models` is discovered
through the Anthropic bridge. See `freellmpool code <agent>`. (Claude Code path is
experimental: text + tools, no vision.)

**Do I need an API key?** No — Pollinations and OVHcloud work with no key, so a fresh
install answers immediately. Add free keys for the other providers for more models and
higher limits.

**Is it free and open source?** Yes, MIT-licensed. More at the
[project page](https://0xzr.github.io/freellmpool/).

## Contributing

New providers and fixes to stale limits are the most useful contributions, and
both are usually a small change to `providers.toml`. See
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Tests run with no network access:

```bash
